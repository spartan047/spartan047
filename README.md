- 👋 Hi, I’m @spartan047
- 👀 I’m interested in Wiki Markup Code, Microsoft Office, GUIs, Microsoft Windows, Linux (Ubuntu, RedHat, Linux Mint), macOS, Android, iOS, HTML, C, C++, Java, C#, and .NET Framework
- 🌱 I’m currently learning shell scripting, professional video gaming (recording, analyzing, practicing hitscan and leading shots, for example), Python, AWS, system administration programming, and web programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with other system administrators for now as I am learning web or Python scripting but am familiar with older programming languages and some shell scripting.
- 📫 How to reach me: spartan.sierra.047@gmail.com. I can also let you know my WhatsApp or Signal chat if we gel together!
